//LoadImageOperation is subclass of Operation. It is a syncrounous operation so only a custom intializer and main method is implemented.

    //private property to be set in intialization to save url for fetching image
    private var imageURL: URL!
    
    //Public (only get) property to fetch the image set as a result of operation
    private(set) var image: NSImage?

    //This is the task which operation does. Its the requirement for subclassing Operation.
    //Its important to check if the operation was cancelled before doing actual work.
    //Places to check for isCancelled,
    //Immediately before you perform any actual work
    //At least once during each iteration of a loop, or more frequently if each iteration is relatively long
    //At any points in your code where it would be relatively easy to abort the operation
    override func main() {
        //check if operation was cancelled before performing any thing
